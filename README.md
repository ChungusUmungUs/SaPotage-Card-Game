# SaPotage-Card-Game
A party card game for 3-6 players about a cutthroat cooking competition. To play, print out the files in the Printouts folder and follow the instructions in the Rules Document. For a standard consumer printer, I recommend using 250gsm cardstock to print out the cards, as many consumer printers struggle with thicker/heavier card stock.
